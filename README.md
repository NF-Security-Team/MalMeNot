Log Gathering & IR Analysis TOOL

Tool born to analyze faster potentially infected windows environments during Incident Response Cases.

Written completely in C#.

USE CASES:

1) Get Remote access into the machine that you have to analyze --> Run MalMeNot
2) Check for Persistences with Autoruns or similar products
3) Check for Malicious running processes
4) At this point MalMeNot should have finished, so start analyzing all the log files it made and in the meanwhile save the "%COMPUTERNAME%.zip" file locally (for further analysis)
5) Clean the infected machine
6) Run MalMeNot again to have the evidences of your Job


WHAT'S LEFT TO DO
1) Add more logs to gather
2) Optimize the code execution speed
3) Optimize the file retrieving methods
4) Anything useful during IR
5) ...many more stuff
